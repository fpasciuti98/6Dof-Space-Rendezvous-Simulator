6-DoF simulator of a space rendez-vous between chaser and target.
chaser data 
To carry out the simulation, click run in the Matlab script MAIN-6DoF-RV.

A menu will appear where you can select two types of control algorithms
for the final approach phase:
--------------------------------------------
Select Final-Approach Control Algorithm
1 : open loop      
2 : SMC     
--------------------------------------------
Type in the desired number and click enter.
Another menu allows you to choose the control algorithm
for attitude dynamics:
--------------------------------------------
Select Attitude Control Algorithm
1 : PD     
2 : SMC   
--------------------------------------------
Type in the desired number and click enter.
The simulation is started in Rapid accelerator mode.

Once the simulation is complete, the results display menu appears on the screen:

--------------------------------------------------------------
- 1 : print phases initial and final positions        
- 2 : position plots                                 
- 3 : attitude plot                                  
- 4 : position animation                     
- 5 : attitude animation                    
- 9 : EXIT                                           

+++ DO NOT CLOSE plot window until animation is completed +++

 Enter key: 
--------------------------------------------------------------

Select the number of the results to be displayed and click enter.
For animations (option 4 and 5), it is necessary to wait until they are completed
before closing the plot window.

To end the display of results, type 9 and
 confirm your choice.
